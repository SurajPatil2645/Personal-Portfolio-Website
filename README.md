## HTML Concepts Learned
- HTML5 structure using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`  
- Semantic elements: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`  
- Forms and validation using `input`, `textarea`, `required`, `pattern`, and `type="email"`  
- Anchor tags for internal and external navigation  
- Image accessibility using meaningful `alt` attributes  
- Ordered and unordered lists for structured content  

---

## CSS Concepts Used
- External CSS file for separation of structure and styling  
- Element, class, and ID selectors  
- Flexbox for navigation and layout  
- Card-based layouts using box model properties  
- Hover effects using `:hover` pseudo-class  
- CSS transitions and keyframe animations  
- Custom fonts using Google Fonts  
- Media queries for responsive design  

---

## Design Decisions
- A dark theme with teal accent colors was chosen for a modern appearance  
- Card-based layouts were used for projects and resume sections  
- Minimalistic design was maintained for readability  
- Hover and animation effects were added to improve user interaction  

---

## Responsiveness Approach
- Media queries adapt layout for mobile and tablet screens  
- Navigation and content stack vertically on smaller devices  
- Images resize automatically for different screen widths  
- The website is usable across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
